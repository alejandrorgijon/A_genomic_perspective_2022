The here available summary table was used in Figure 1 in <b>Rodríguez-Gijón and Nuy et al., 2022 (<i>Frontiers in Microbiology</i>)</b>. We include below  information on how this table was created:

```
In this review, we have included  64,500 environmental MAGs available via two recently published 
datasets, stratfreshDB and GEMs. StratfreshDB offers 12,000 MAGs (>40% completeness) from 41 
stratified lakes and ponds assembled with Megahit (v1.1.13) and binned with Metabat (v2.12.1) 
(Buck et al., 2021a). GEMs offers  52,000 MAGs (>50% completeness) from > 10,000 metagenomes 
collected from diverse habitats on Earth (Nayfach et al., 2020). GEMs dataset was assembled 
using metaSPAdes and binned with Metabat (v0.32.5). After dereplication using fastANI and 
mOTUlizer (Jain et al., 2018; Buck et al., 2021b), our meta-analysis includes 17 834 mOTUs, with 
one representative MAG each (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%, assessed with CheckM 
v1.1.3) (Parks et al., 2015). We complemented these environmental MAGs by adding 8 267 
representative genomes (>90% complete) of isolates from GTDB (Parks et al., 2020; Figure 1A). 
These genomes are marked in the GTDB databases (release 95) to originate from culture collections. 
After clustering at 95% ANI threshold, 540 mOTUs contained representatives from both environmental 
MAGs and isolate genomes (Figure 1C).

Please note that the  table has 4 genomes of origin in "Air" environment which we did not include in our meta analysis.
